This is an impactJS plugin.

It uses HQX (2, 3 or 4x) pixel upscaling method, instead of nearest neighbor interpolation.

What it does is basically wrapping the hqx javascript port (https://github.com/phoboslab/js-hqx) into a impactjs plugin, by injecting a new ig.Image.resize() function.

Usage : 

1./ Simply require the plugin in main.js (or whatever main js file)

    ig.module( 
      'game.main' 
    )
    .requires(
	'impact.game',
	'plugins.hqx'
      /*...*/
    )
    /*../


2./ Init your game with a scale factor of 2, 3 or 4.

    ig.main( '#canvas', MyGame, 60, 240, 160, 4 );
